# CausationEntropy Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Practicing active inclusivity by making space for voices from marginalized or underrepresented groups.
* Using inclusive language, including gender-neutral terms, people-first language (e.g. “person with a disability”), and respecting pronouns.
* Centering accessibility: sharing materials in accessible formats, using captions, and being mindful of diverse needs.
* Recognizing privilege and working to counterbalance it, rather than dominating conversations.
* Amplifying others’ contributions, especially those who may be overlooked or interrupted.
* Engaging in bystander intervention — respectfully stepping in when witnessing harmful behavior, and supporting those impacted.
* Seeking consent before recording, photographing, or sharing others’ contributions.
* Practicing cultural humility, by being open to learning from different perspectives and traditions without stereotyping or appropriating.
* Acknowledging impact over intent, and being willing to repair harm if one’s actions caused harm regardless of intention.
* Mentoring and uplifting newer or less experienced members of the community.
* Celebrating diversity — recognizing that a variety of backgrounds and perspectives strengthens the community.
* Being accountable by apologizing sincerely, correcting mistakes, and striving to do better.
* Sharing resources equitably — ensuring that knowledge, opportunities, and tools are not gatekept.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Intentionally misgendering someone
* Discrimination or exclusionary behavior based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodiversity, age, body size, socioeconomic status, education level, or religious/non-religious background.
* Ableism, such as mocking someone’s disability, disregarding accessibility needs, or creating barriers for participation.
* Racism, xenophobia, or cultural appropriation, including use of slurs, stereotypes, or mocking accents.
* Classism and elitism, such as belittling people based on income, employment status, or educational background.
* Fatphobia or body shaming, including derogatory remarks or assumptions about body shape or size.
* Ageism, such as dismissing contributions based on someone being “too young” or “too old.”
* Tokenism (e.g., singling someone out to speak “on behalf of” a group or identity).
* Dismissive or invalidating remarks toward lived experiences of marginalized people.
* Deadnaming or refusing to use someone’s correct pronouns.
* Retaliation against someone who reports a code-of-conduct concern.
* Gaslighting or minimizing harm, such as telling others they are “overreacting” when expressing discomfort.
* Non-consensual physical contact or physical intimidation, even if not overtly sexual.
* Disrespecting boundaries, including ignoring requests to stop a behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, meetings, or collaborative work.
* Dog-whistling or coded language that perpetuates systemic oppression, even subtly.

## Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge that our community exists on lands that have long been home to Indigenous peoples who continue to endure the impacts of colonization, displacement, and erasure. We recognize that these lands were taken through violence and broken treaties, and that the legacies of dispossession remain present today.

This acknowledgement is not a substitute for action. We commit to learning from Indigenous knowledge systems, supporting Indigenous sovereignty, and working toward decolonization in our practices and policies. We invite all community members to reflect on their own positionality and responsibilities, and to act in solidarity with Indigenous peoples both locally and globally.

We also affirm that our community rejects all forms of colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and cultural erasure — past and present. We are committed to naming and resisting systems of oppression that normalize or excuse violence against entire peoples, and to building a community grounded in justice, dignity, and liberation for all.

These principals are non-negotiable and failure to uphold these values will result in a permanent ban.

## Application of our Software to Socially Harmful Applications

Our software is created with the intent to advance research, education, and positive social impact. We are committed to ensuring that the tools we build are not misused in ways that cause harm to individuals or communities.

Accordingly, we prohibit applications of our software that contribute to:

- Surveillance, profiling, or policing practices that target marginalized communities.
- Military or paramilitary operations, or any use that supports armed conflict or occupation.
- Predictive policing, criminal justice, or carceral systems, which reinforce systemic inequities and racial injustice.
- Exploitation or discrimination, including systems that replicate or amplify biases against people based on race, gender, sexuality, disability, class, religion, or other protected characteristics.
- Environmental harm, such as extractive or exploitative practices that disregard sustainability or Indigenous sovereignty.
- Misinformation or disinformation, including uses that intentionally deceive or manipulate public understanding.
- Corporate or governmental practices that prioritize profit or control at the expense of human rights and dignity.

We encourage applications that uplift communities, advance equity, and expand knowledge. Any project that undermines these values is not aligned with our community or its goals.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
pydmd.info@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
